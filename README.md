## Overview
**GHOST-APIInspector** is engineered to provide deep empirical reconnaissance, asset discovery, and security posture validation for authorized red team engagements. Designed for high-performance execution via command-line interface, it eliminates speculative outputs and relies entirely on empirical socket handshakes, protocol banners, and structured signature databases.

---

## Key Capabilities
- **Automated Banner & Interface Initialization**: Instantly clears terminal buffer, displays the authorized Ghost-SY1 operational banner, and accepts live target input.
- **Empirical Reconnaissance Engine**: Executes direct protocol probing and signature matching against structured local databases.
- **Standardized Audit Trails**: Automatically exports machine-readable assessment reports in JSON and CSV formats.

```

---

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhostSy1/GHOST-APIInspector.git
cd GHOST-APIInspector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Operational Usage
Execute the tool directly from the terminal:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
Upon execution, the terminal will prompt for the target IP, hostname, or configuration path, executing the assessment sequence and writing structured reports to disk.

---

## Audit Reports
Generated reports include precise timestamps, target parameters, verified signatures, and operational status logs saved under `reports/` and root output files (`report.json`).
