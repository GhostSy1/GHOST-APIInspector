# Project Governance

## Repository identity

This document records the engineering baseline for **GHOST-APIInspector**. The implementation is expected to consume operator-supplied inputs and produce observations that can be traced to source data. It must not invent findings, hide errors, or claim capabilities that are not implemented.

## Review contract

| Review area | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Input boundary | Documented target, file, or data source and authorization assumptions |
| Output contract | Stable report or CLI behavior with error handling |
| Safety | No embedded credentials, destructive defaults, or undocumented network activity |
| Verification | Reproducible local command and automated checks where practical |
| Documentation | Installation, usage, architecture, limitations, and responsible-use guidance |

## Public-release gate

Before a release is made public, inspect tracked files for secrets, private keys, customer data, generated engagement artifacts, fabricated results, and unsafe operational material. A public repository should expose the engineering method and defensive value without exposing credentials or instructions for unauthorized access.

## Versioning

Record user-visible changes in the README or a changelog. Do not label a feature as complete until the implementation and its verification path exist in the repository.
